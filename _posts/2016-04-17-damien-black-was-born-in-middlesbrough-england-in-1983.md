Damien Black was born in Middlesbrough, England in 1983\.

Damien has worked with many industry professionals and his work has been exhibited in many places such as the Design Museum, London. He won a competition with Samsung and he also shot London Fashion Week.

Damien often finds inspiration in the works of Cindy Sherman, Diane Arbus, Bill Cunningham and David Bailey. The most prominent creative feature he looks for is the ability to explore personality. Behaviour and appearance have always been fascinating to him and he finds it rewarding to show people how they are in their best light.

These moments are fleeting and precious.
